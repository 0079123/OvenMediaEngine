# Test Player

We have prepared a test player so that you can easily check that the OvenMediaEngine is working well. Browsers apply security policies that can not connect to HTTP or WS \(WebSockets\) that are not secure on TLS-based HTTPS sites. So we have prepared both HTTP and HTTPS based players as follows:

| Site URL | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [http://demo.ovenplayer.com](http://demo.ovenplayer.com) | Player without TLS that can test all streaming URLs based on WS: //, WSS: //, HTTP: //, HTTPS: // |
| [https://demo.ovenplayer.com](https://demo.ovenplayer.com) | Player with TLS that can only test WSS: // and HTTPS: // based streaming URLs |
